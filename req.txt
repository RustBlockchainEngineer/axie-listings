I am looking for an expert python and smart contract developer,
preferebly with experience developing scripts that interact
with Axie Infinity sidechain (Ronin) or equivalent blockchains.

The project will be divided in various deliverables, the first
one consists on a python script that can be run locally or in a
notebook in the cloud that retrieves all axie listings in axie
marketplace in real time by querying or connecting to Ronin blockchain.

Other deliverables will be described and considered down the road.
Please submit your proposal based on this specific deliverable only.
It should be a piece of cake for any python/blockchain expert.

The output of the code should be a life for each new axie listing
containing all the relevant information
id, properties, stats, price, etc.
If you open any as an example, you will find all these characteristics...
id, class, breed count, stats, body parts, abilities, etc.
sorry i said life before but i meant line
every time an axie is listed, the python code should print a line with all the information of that axie
